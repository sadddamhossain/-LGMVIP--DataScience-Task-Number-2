# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM
Here are the steps you can follow to perform stock market prediction and forecasting using a Stacked LSTM model:

1. **Data Collection:**
   Collect historical stock market data for the stock you want to predict. This data usually includes attributes like opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and trading volume.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
   - Normalize the data using techniques like Min-Max scaling to bring all features to a common scale between 0 and 1.

3. **Data Preparation:**
   - Decide on a suitable time step for creating input sequences (e.g., past 60 days' data to predict the next day's price).
   - Use the `create_dataset` function (similar to the one you provided earlier) to create input-output pairs for training and testing.
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.

4. **Model Architecture:**
   - Import the necessary libraries: `from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential` and `from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense`.
   - Create a Sequential model.
   - Add multiple LSTM layers with appropriate units and `return_sequences=True` for stacked LSTM.
   - Add a Dense output layer with one neuron for prediction.

5. **Model Compilation:**
   - Compile the model using an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and a loss function (e.g., mean squared error).

6. **Model Training:**
   - Train the model using `model.fit` with the training data.
   - Monitor validation loss to avoid overfitting (you can use early stopping if needed).

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using various metrics, such as RMSE or MAE.
   - Plot the predicted vs. actual stock prices to visually assess the model's performance.

8. **Forecasting:**
   - Prepare the input data for the next `time_step` days (using the most recent historical data).
   - Create input sequences for prediction using this data.
   - Use the trained model to predict the stock prices for the next `time_step` days.
   - Apply inverse scaling to get the predictions in their original scale.

9. **Visualization:**
   - Plot the predicted stock prices for the next `time_step` days along with the historical data and actual stock prices.
   - Visualize how well the model's predictions align with the actual stock prices.
